# Welcome
Hi there! Welcome to my GitHub profile. I'm Divyam Chauhan, and I'm thrilled to share with you my latest creationâ€”a web-based music player application. This project was born out of my passion for both music and coding, and I've poured my heart and soul into developing it.

With this application, I aim to combine the power of technology with the universal language of music. Whether you're a casual listener or a devoted audiophile, this music player is designed to enhance your listening experience and provide a seamless interface to explore your favorite tunes.

# Melodix 

Melodix is a simple music player web application that allows you to listen to your favorite songs. It provides a user-friendly interface where you can browse and play songs from a curated playlist. This project can be easily hosted on any web server and accessed through a web browser.
